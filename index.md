I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/) in the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.  There, I am fortunate to work with [Ivan Diaz](https://www.idiaz.xyz/) and [Wenbo Wu](https://www.wenbowu.me/). We are developing theory and methods at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference, and applying them to problems in healthcare provider profiling.

Before my postdoc, I did my PhD in [Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by [Zach Branson](https://sites.google.com/site/zjbranson/?pli=1) and [Edward Kennedy](https://www.ehkennedy.com/). Additionally, I had the pleasure of working with [Siva Balakrishnan](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~siva/) and [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/). 

My primary research interests are at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and causal inference. Some specific topics I have worked on include 

* Stochastic and dynamic interventions for observational causal inference ([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10532) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03578))
* Sensitivity analyses for observational causal inference ([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08738)) 
* Heterogeneous effect estimation (for [incremental effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03578))
* Nonparametric doubly robust minimax estimation ([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15175))

During my PhD, I also gained invaluable teaching experience. Twice, I instructed CMU's Sophomore-level *Introduction to Statistical Inference* course. Additionally, I had the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant for several courses related to causal inference and other areas of statistics. 

I completed my undergraduate education at Swarthmore College, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics in 2016.  Before starting my PhD, I worked for three years as a Research Analyst and later as a Senior Research Analyst at the Brattle Group. There, I helped analyze data and build statistical models for legal, regulatory, and policy issues.  In particular, I learned a huge amount from [Charlie Gibbons](https://gibbons.bio/), who inspired me to pursue a career in econometrics/statistics/ML.
